## Automatic Water Pump Switch with Smart Level Indicator

## Introduction

The economic crisis in Sri Lanka has led to a shortage of power supply, affecting daily household activities. It is crucial to minimize power wastage during these challenging times. One common issue in many households is forgetting to switch off the water pump after turning it on. This not only leads to water overflow but also results in power wastage. The root causes of this problem include forgetfulness and the absence of a method to indicate the current water level in the tank.

In addition to this, households face two more challenges: 

1. They need a way to automatically switch on the water pump before the tank runs empty.
2. They want to know the current water level to ensure there is enough water remaining until the power is restored, as the country experiences multiple power cuts each day.

To address these issues, we have developed an innovative solution - the **Automatic Water Pump Switch with Level Indicator**.

## Features

Our Automatic Water Pump Switch with Level Indicator offers the following key features:

1. **Water Level Indicator**: The device accurately measures and displays the current water level in the tank, eliminating the need for guesswork.

2. **Automatic Pump Control**: The system is designed to automatically switch on the water pump when the water level in the tank drops below a certain threshold, ensuring a continuous water supply.

3. **Power-Efficient**: By preventing unnecessary pump operation, our device helps conserve electricity during power shortages, contributing to energy savings.

4. **Alerts**: Users receive alerts when the water level is critically low, allowing them to take necessary actions to avoid running out of water.

## Installation

To install the Automatic Water Pump Switch with Level Indicator, follow these steps:

1. **Mounting**: Attach the level sensor to the water tank according to the provided instructions.

2. **Electrical Connection**: Connect the device to the power supply and the water pump. Ensure that you follow all safety guidelines during the installation process.

3. **Calibration**: Calibrate the device to set the desired water level threshold for automatic pump activation. Detailed instructions are provided in the user manual.

## Usage

Using the Automatic Water Pump Switch with Level Indicator is straightforward:

1. Monitor the water level on the display to keep track of the tank's status.

2. When the water level falls below the set threshold, the device will automatically activate the water pump.

3. Receive alerts when the water level becomes critically low, prompting you to take action to avoid water shortage.
